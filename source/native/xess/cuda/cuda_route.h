// The tensor-core route for XeFG's ported MFG model.
//
// On an NVIDIA adapter with compute capability 7.5 (RTX 20; not the Turing parts without tensor
// cores), 8.6 (RTX 30), 8.9 (RTX 40) or 12.0 (RTX 50), each Dispatch of a
// recognized int8 conv layer program becomes a launch of the equivalent CUDA kernel
// (xefg_cuda_layers.cu) in the same D3D12 command list, through NvAPI_D3D12_LaunchCubinShader:
// no CUDA context, no second queue, no fence. The kernel reads and writes the layer's own
// descriptors (the tables XeFG bound for that Dispatch), and its output is byte-identical to the
// Intel program's (tests/xess_cuda).
//
// Recognition is exact: a pipeline state counts only when the provider image created it from a
// program whose SHA-256 is in the layer table: directly, through the wrapper of its device, or
// through a module that hooks pipeline creation in between, the provider's image then
// being a frame of a bounded stack walk above that module. A Dispatch is replaced only when its recording
// state is complete on the recording thread and every handle resolves; anything else keeps the
// Dispatch, which runs the DXIL port as before.
//
// Only the provider's own command lists are hooked: the lists its image creates (the device's
// CreateCommandList/CreateCommandList1) get their first Reset there and the hooks go into the table
// each list then keeps. Agility SDK runtimes give every list its own table on that Reset; the
// runtime's shared tables, copied into every game list's, are not written.
